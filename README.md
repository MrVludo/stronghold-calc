A program to calculate the coordinates of the stronghold knowing angles and positions of two thrown eyes of Ender. 
Made for Minecraft video game by Vludo (MrVludo).

Add to PATH and use as a command in terminal, PowerShell or the cmd.
The command is just "stronghold".

Can be used without any arguments, it will ask them.
However, the coordinates can be written as arguments in the following order:
First X, First Z, First angle, Second X, Second Z, Second angle.

For example: 
The values are (you get them from F3 in a game): 
1st place: x = 186 and z = 193, the angle is -18.9 
2nd place: x = 403 and z = 271, the angle is -12.9

The command should be:
> stronghold 186 193 -18.9 403 271 -12.9

Result:
Stronghold:

 Overworld:
 X: 787 Z: 1949

 Nether:
 X: 98 Z: 243
